    "# Introduction\n",
    "An accident is an unplanned event that sometimes has inconvenient or undesirable consequences, other times being inconsequential. The occurrence of such an event may or may not have unrecognized or unaddressed risks contributing to its cause. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term \"accident\" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common accident that people think is transportation accidents especially road accidents. This type of accident often occured in daily basis and we should try to minimize it. By looking from past accident we can get a lot of information to minimize or even prevent this kind of accident including the most common hour of accident occured, the most common place, factor that affects severity, and the most common type of accidents. With this information, we can educate people to be more careful in certain type of condition for people that ride. This information may also help people to consider their home, office, school, etc. For the government this information helps them to create strategy to minimize road accidents."
